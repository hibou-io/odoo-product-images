# Deprecated

This repository, and thus the module `product_images`, is deprecated. 
Please check our our other open source efforts at [Hibou.io](https://hibou.io/)

## History and Use
Back in Odoo **9.0**, products did not have multiple images.  This functionality was added to the core in Odoo **10.0** and Hibou's `product_images` module was so similar (only a field name was different, Odoo S.A. even used the same model name I did) that it could be upgraded to **10.0** and still preserve the same images that were already uploaded.

It is also to install this in **11.0**, but thats the end of the road.  The module should be removed at this point.
